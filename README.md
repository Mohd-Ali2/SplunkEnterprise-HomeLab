## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a small Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab using Splunk Enterprise.

The lab simulates real-world attack scenarios against a Windows endpoint while collecting Windows Event Logs and Sysmon telemetry for investigation, detection, and incident response.

The goal is to gain practical experience with SIEM, endpoint telemetry, threat detection, log analysis, and SOC workflows.
